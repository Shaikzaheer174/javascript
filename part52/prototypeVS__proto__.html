      // prototype is related to the function.
      // __proto__ is related to a object.

      let name = "zaheer";
      //   js creates a an str object for name  Ex: name = new String("zaheer"); and it also adds __proto__ property to that object.

      // __proto__ is tells about the object which we have created using which constructor function , thats funtion's prototype is added as __proto__ property to the object we have created.
      //   Ex: name.__proto__  // string
      // name.__proto__ === String.prototype  //true

      let arr = [1, 2, 3];

      function greeting(name, message) {
        this.name = name;
        this.message = message;
        this.greet = function () {
          console.log(`hello ${name} ${message}`);
        };
      }

      g1 = new greeting("zaheer", "Hi");
      g1.greet(); // hello zaheer is Hi

      // prototype is also an object we can add properties.
      // what ever we add properties those will get inherited to the objects we create.
      greeting.prototype.greeting = function () {
        console.log("hello", this.name);
      };
      // by doing this, the advantage is
      //when we create a new object lets say g1, so for name it allocates some memory and for message it allocates some memory and for greet it allocates some memory.

      // and now if we create another object it does the same thing.
      // so, what ever we have in constructor function it allocating seperately for every object we're creating, by doing this so the disadvantage is memory wastage
      // so, instead of doing this.
      //we can do this greeting.prototype.greet , so it wont have seperate memory for the object we're creating. and it will become comman for all objects which we are creating. and it links to that constructor function prototype.
      // and since when we create a object it will get __proto__ which is linked to prototype of that constructor function.

      let personObj = {
        name: "name",
        age: "age",
        //__proto__  //js adds it.
      };
      // personObj = new Object();
      // personObj.__proto__ === Object.prototype //true
      // personObj.__proto__.__proto__ //null because object prototype and personObj __proto__ are same.
      // this is the minimum least object.
      // EX: Object.prototype.__proto__ //null
      //personObj.hasOwnProperty("name")  //true
