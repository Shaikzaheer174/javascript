- Javascript can be used for dynamic interaction for our web page.
- JS it is a scripting language. means suppose you have written 10lines of code and if the error is at 9th line then till line 8 it will get output.
- 3 ways we can print in js.

1. alert()
2. document.write() // our page is treated as object in javascript and we call it as document.
3. innerhtml // <h1>this is innerhtml</h1> the content between the tags.

- Roadmap:

variables
- we cannot define const without initalizing. else it will throw an error  Missing initializer in const declaration.
- using var we can define same variable name n times but cannot with let and const
- let and const have block scope.

data types:
primitive datatypes means primary data types
primitive datatypes:
- Numbers
- string
- boolean

special:
- undefined
- null

Composite:
- array
- object

- - javascript is a dynamic typed language.
