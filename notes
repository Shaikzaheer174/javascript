part1:
- Javascript can be used for dynamic interaction for our web page.
- JS it is a scripting language. means suppose you have written 10lines of code and if the error is at 9th line then till line 8 it will get output.
- 3 ways we can print in js.

1. alert()
2. document.write() // our page is treated as object in javascript and we call it as document.
3. innerhtml // <h1>this is innerhtml</h1> the content between the tags.

part3:
variables
---------
- we cannot define const without initalizing. else it will throw an error  Missing initializer in const declaration.
- using var we can define same variable name n times but cannot with let and const
- let and const have block scope.

part4:
data types:
-----------
primitive datatypes means primary data types
primitive datatypes:
- Numbers
- string
- boolean

special:
- undefined
- null

Composite: grouping primitives and creating a data type is called as a composite.
- array
- object

- - javascript is a dynamic typed language.

part5:
operators:
---------
Arithmetic opeartors
comparison operators
logical operators
assignment operators
type operators
bitwise operators
ternary operators
unary operators (post and pre increment/decrement)

logical operators:
&& operator returns value of the second operand if the first operand evaluates to true
only in case of 0 or empty string '' , it is false 

Bitwise operators:
converts numbers into binary system then performs the operations.

ternary operators:
Three operands --> condition ? expression1 : expression2;

part6:
- typecasting or type conversion
- implicit and explicit conversion

part7:
types of conditional statements:
1. if statement
2. if-else statement
3. if-else if-else statement
4. switch statement

part8:
loops:
to do a task multiple times then we use loops.
loops are also called as iterative statements
1. for loop
2. while loop
3. do-while loop
the above three loops are used for sequence of statements or a block of code, or iterate till the condition is false we use above three loops.
4. for in loop
5. for of loop

part9:
template literals:
- `${}`

part10:
for in VS for of loops
-used in iterable data types like strings, arrays, objects in these for every element if we want to iterate over then we use the for..in and for..of loops

part11:
arrays:
1. why arrays
2. how to declare arrays
3. how to access arrays elements
4. how to update or add elements to the array (array is a hetrogenious type means any data type we can store in it.)
5. methods on arrays

part12:

what is a function
why functions
how to create functions
how to call functions
what is function expression

part13:
types of functions

part14:
Scopes in JavaScript
Global scope
Local scope
block level scope

part15:
## default and rest parameters

part16:
## foreach method

part17:
## sets

part18:
## objects
- 5 ways we can create objects in javascript
- 1. Object literals
- 2. using a new keyword with object constructor
- 3. using a new keyword with a constructor function
- 4. Object.create() method
- 5. Classes

part19:
## console methods

part20:
## Dom
- document object model
- by using HTML DOM javascript can access, change or remove any elements of html document and also can create new elements at any position.
- when webpage is loaded,browser creates DOM of the webpage.
- document object has properties and methods so by using those we can select/modify/remove/create html elements and we can also add/remove/change styles to those HTML elements.
We have 5 methods to select HTML elements:
1. document.getElementById("idName") --> returns element with the specified id. and if don't have the specified id then returns null.
2. document.getElementsByClassName('className) --> returns list of all elements belong to the specified class.
3. document.getElementsByTagName("tagName") --> returns list of all elements with the specified tag.
4. document.querySelector(".class/#id/tagName") --> returns the first object matching css style selector.
5. document.querySelectorAll(".class/#id/tagName") --> returns all objects matches the css style selector.

document also has properties few of them are :
1. document.body
2. document.head
3. document.title
4. document.links //anchors
5. document.forms
6. document.images
7. document.scripts

part21:
DOM manipulation:
1. how to create HTML elements. //only empty tags will get created with out content ex: <h1></h1>
2. how to set content to element. // we need to set content
3. how to append a new element //then we need to append new element in the tree note: append will add the element at the end.
4. how to insert an element before another element //instead of appending at the end to insert it before another element.
5. how to remove an element //to remove an existing element.
6. how to remove child element // to remove element's child
7. how to replace element // to replace an element.

part22:
add/change styles in javascript
1. how to change style of element
2. how to get attribute value of an element
3. how to set/change attribute of an element.

part23:
## model windows
- model windows means after opening our web page, upon that a window is opened(model window) once it is opened, without closing it we can not further interact without web page.
-js contains mainly 3 model windows.
1. alert() - to show message to the user
2. prompt() - to take some input from the user
3. confirm() - to get confirmation from the user.

part24:
## Events
1. what is event and types of events
2. what is event handler
3. ways to handle events.

# Event:
Event is nothing but an action. 
eventlistener is a function or method that listens to specific events (ex: click), when that event is triggered then it get activated
and executes the function called eventhandler.
Using eventlistener when the event is occurred then we execute the particular function (eventhandler).

in webpage also what ever user do is everything is an event.

# who generates an events
user -> keypress, scroll, focus, etc...
system -> load, error, abort, etc...

# types of user generated events:
browser specific events ->  scrollup/down, resize browser.
DOM/ web page specific events -> click, focus, hover.

event listeners and event handlers
#event listener is a function that listens for a specific event and triggers another function(the event handler)when the event occurs.
#event handler is a function that handles (or responds to) a specific event when triggered by an event listener. or event handler is a function we write to run when an event happens.
 
types of events:
# mouse events:
click, double click, mouseover, mouseout, mouse move

# keyboard events:
key down, key up, key press

# focus events:
focus, blur, focusin, focusout

# form events:
submit, reset, change


### 3 ways to handle events.
1. inline event handlers(using the event attribute in html)
EX: <button onclick="js code">

# for all the above events if we add on at starting then its called event listeners

2. using event properties in JS.
EX: let btn = document.getElementById("b1)
    btn.onclick = function name/anonymous function

3. using addEventListener() method in JS
EX: let btn = document.getElementById("b1)
    btn.addEventListener(eventName, function/anonymous fun)


## setTimeout() and settimeinterval() functions

var a = setTimeout(
        function (name) {
          alert("Hellooo! " + name);
          console.log("Hellooo! after timeout");
        },
        5000,
        "zaheer"
      );

a stores the timer id of the function
and we cancel the function execution without executing after a particular time by using
clearInterval(a)


## map() method:
- it is related to arrays method. 
- it is used for modify already existing array data and create's a new array with modified data we can use map() method.
- Suppose, you receive a list of users objects and you need to extract only the names of the users into new array. 

## filter() method:
-  used to filter arrays data 

note: 
  why we are using maps and filters in the sense
  Ex: for(let i = 0; i <5; i++){
        console.log(users[i].firstname)
      }  //but it does not create an array and doesn't stores the values inside it. and we cannot do chaining like map the for that result we filter then so on...

## reduce() method:
- it is also used for arrays.
- array.reduce(function, accumulator or default value)
- function can take 4 arguments.
- function(accumulator value, element, index, array)  //accumulator is a first argument.
- array.reduce(function(acc, elem, index, array){}, 8)
- this method returns a single value.
// reduce method will iterate over the array and calls the function for each element and compares with accumulator and so on..


## array methods: 
- find() method
- some() method
- every() method
these are callback functions

## spread operator:

## form validation

## callback functions
- callback function is a function that is passing as a an argument to the another function

## higher Order Functions

## closure
- closure is --> if we  decalre any variables in a function, after running that function if we can use those variables outside of that function then it is called as closure.


## this keyword
- function is different and method is different that is if we define a function in an object then that is called as method.


## call,apply,bind methods 

## optional chaining 
- null, underfined aaye jab koi object me aur uske baad koi object properties access kar rahe tho error aatha hai, therfore ? use karne se simply undefined return karte hain aur uske niche ka code bhi run hotha hain.

## date object

## math object
- sign()
- abs()
- sqrt()
- pow()
- max()
- min()
- round()
- ceil()
- floor()
- trunc()
- random()
- exp()
- log2()
- log10()

toUpperCase() 
concat()
trim()
split() 
startsWith() 
endsWith()

replace()

##  window object
- document
- innerWidth
- outerWidth
- innerHeight
- outerHeight
- location
- closed
- name
- navigator

## window.open()  and window.close() methods

## moveTo() and moveBy() and reSizeTo() and reSizeBy() methods

## asynchronous javascript

## AJAX
- AJAX - Asynchronous javascript and XML :)
- AJAX helps in fetching data asynchronously from remote webserver [helps to display the data dynamically in our web page.]
- data loaded by ajax call is done by asynchronously without page refresh.
- web server will send response which contains data that we have requested.
- data can be of any formats like JSON,XML.
- initially servers used to send data in XML format.

- in javascript, we have to use XMLHttpRequest object to make the AJAX call to exchange data from webserver.
- AJAX request can be send to server in with 3 steps:
1. create XMLHttpRequest object
    EX: let xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
2. create request with that object open() method
    EX: syntax: open(method[post/get], url, async[true/false], username, password); //async if you give as true then below code will get executed else holds till reponse we receive. and username and password are optional based on endpoint.
3. send the request using send() method.

<!-- methods -->
- With the help of Ajax, instead of reloading page, only required portion we can update it.

- send() method, if we won't pass parameters then it takes GET method. 

- send(string), sends the request to the server used for POST requests.

- setRequestHeader() -> adds a label/value pairs of the headers to be sent.

- abort() -> cancel the current request.

- getAllresponseHeaders() -> returns header information.

- getResponseHeaders() -> returns specific header information.

<!-- porperties -->
- onLoad --> when the request is complete and the response is fully downloaded

- onReadyStateChange --> defines a function to be called when the readystate property changes.

- onProgress --> triggers periodically while the response is being downloaded, reports how much has been downloaded.

- readyState --> holds the status of the XMLHttpRequest.
0. request not initialized
1. server connection established
2. request received
3. processing request
4. request finished and response is ready.

- responseText --> returns the response data as a string

- responseXML --> returns the response data as XML data.

- status --> returns the status number of the request 200 ok, 404 not found.

- statusText --> returns the status text (ok or not found)

## callback hell 

## promise 

## fetch API

## asynce and await.

## ErrorHandling try and catch.

## prototype vs __proto__

## destructuring

## strict mode

## regular expressions

## debugging

## async vs defer in script tag.
. <script src="script1.js"></script> in head tag if we add this script tag, js will stop parsing html until js script loaded and executed successfully then only it will parse html. till that if we have any html elements which we need in js scripts then if it is not available then we'll get an error.
Ex: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'innerText')

- so avoid this we can use two keywords, so that it will continue the html parsing even it is loading the script or executing the script.
1. async and
2. differ

- differ means:  <script differ src="script1.js"></script> while loading this script1.js html parsing should not required to stop, it will tell to engine. and the script will execute only after html parsing is done.

- async means: downlaoding of script will be done parallel with html parsing, but execution should be done once the script is loaded/downlaoded.

in normal script tag <script here it wont work> js code. </script>

## Execution context:
- js engine is responsible for executing(running) our code.
- Execution context is nothing but an env where our code is stored to execute
- Execution context created in 2 scenarios.
1. once for whole js code. //(global execution context)
2. and when ever a function is called in program, another new execution env will be created.(function execution context)

- when ever execution context is created it has 2 components
1. memory component // it allows or allocates the memory
2. code component // code.

- execution context has 2 phases
1. creation memory //initially it creates a memory and assigns undefined
2. execution phase // assigns the values

- once it encounters any function calls, then it creates a new function execution context for that function.
same again 
1. memory component // it allows or allocates the memory
also creates a arguments property and length property. and it si only for  function execution context
2. code component // code.

and call stack will store the call and executes it.
