      // Event loop is responsible for asynchronous programming.
      // Event loop is a program which runs continuously until page closed or when application terminated.
      // Event loop is one of the component of js run time env.
      // js run time env has many components work together to manage and executing code.they are
      // javascript engine, event loop, web API's/Browser API's, callback queue(task queue), microtask queue, memory heap.
      // event loop's activity is to check the tasks and add it to callstack.
      // once we run the program globalexecution context will be created and for functions and var's memory will be allocated. and once we call the function
      // then it enters into call stack and executes the code, while if we have settimeout, set interval or fetch() then tose are pushed into task queue and microtask queues.
      // then event loop will check if call stack iss free then event loop will add the tasks from task and microtasks to the callstack.
      // so it monitors call stack, task queue and microtask queue continuously.
