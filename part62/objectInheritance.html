      // if we want to create a one more same object like above, in js we have a one of the way is to use Object.create()
      // EX:
      obj2 = Object.create(obj1);

      console.log(obj1); //{name: 'name1', age: 20}
      console.log(obj2); //{}

      console.log(obj2.name); //name1  it is inherited from obj1 since we don't have name property in obj2

      obj2.name = "name2";
      console.log(obj2.name); //name2
      console.log(obj2); //{name: 'name2'}
      obj2.place = "hyd";

      obj3 = Object.create(obj2);
      console.log(obj3.age); //20   that is from obj1, since it is checking in obj2 and if it is not available then it checks in obj1
