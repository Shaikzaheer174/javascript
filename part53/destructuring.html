      // for example if we want to access any property say city from above obj then
      //console.log(person.address.city); //hyd

      // now instead of that only if i want to access the city of that obj using city then we can use destructuring
      let { name, age } = person; // jo bhi object me property names hai vohi dena chahiye variables names varna undefined aayega.
      console.log(name); //john

      let { address:{ city }} = person; // to get the nexted obj property name    
      console.log(city); //hyd
