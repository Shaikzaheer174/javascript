       * pure function:
       * -------------
       * 1. it has no side effects i.e., that function should not modify the out side data and the arguments which we pass to that function should not be get effected then those functions are called pure functions and
       * 2. it is predictable i.e., how many times we pass the arguments[same] to that function we get the same output.
